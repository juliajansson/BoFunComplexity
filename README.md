Update 2023-12-12: The paper has now been published in Journal of Functional Programming: [https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796823000102](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/levelpcomplexity-of-boolean-functions-using-thinning-memoization-and-polynomials/58122B71C40F99E0D19ACD0FAFF867A9#article).

Associated code for the paper "Level-p-complexity of Boolean Functions using Thinning, Memoization, and Polynomials" (published in JFP as [doi:10.1017/S0956796823000102](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796823000102)) by Julia Jansson and Patrik Jansson.

A preprint is available as [arXiv:2302.02473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02473) and the associated code is available as release [tag/v2023-02.pre-print](https://github.com/juliajansson/BoFunComplexity/releases/tag/v2023-02.pre-print) as the code continues to evolve.

The code was later extended by Christian Sattler.

(The first JFP submission 2023-02 received positive reviews leading to a resubmission 2023-08, [published online 2023-12-12](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796823000102).)

# Errata

On page 19, the sentence

    "The difference [...] factors to exactly and we note that it is non-negative in the whole interval."

should be

    "The difference [...] factors to exactly $p^2(1-p)^2(1-p+p^2)$ and we note that it is non-negative in the whole interval."

# Piecewise polynomials (example results)

All polynomials are described by their list of coefficients starting from degree 0: [1,7,3] means 1 + 7x + 3x^2.

## 3-bit majority

maj3: 1 piece [2,2,-2]

cost(0.5) = 5/2 = 2.5

## 2-level iterated 3-bit majority:

maj3_2: piecewise polynomial in [0, 1]:
+  1 piece [4,4,6,9,-61,23,67,-64,16]

cost(0.5) = 393/64 = 6.140625

sqrt (cost(0.5)) ~= 2.478028450199876

## 2-level iterated 5-bit majority:

maj5_2: piecewise polynomial in [0, 1]:
+  1 piece [9,9,9,30,12,62,-14,816,-2143,-44004,169768,-291977,751873,-2494791,5464225,-8722210,13579067,-21830058,29475938,-29211477,20338155,-9697875,3027801,-559872,46656]

## 3-level iterated 3-bit majority:
We conjecture that this is the piecewise polynomial level-p-complexity function:

### More details

Name the polynomial pieces p1 .. p15 where pmid=p8 is the middle piece.
All p_i have value 8 at both endpoints and around 15 in the middle.

The value at 0.5 is exactly 15796051 % 1048576 (rounded to Double precision: 15.064288139343262).

  (15.064288139343262)**(1/3) = 2.4697303458263957

The pieces are very close: for example let pdiff = p8-p0, then

  pdiff = P [0,0,0,0,6,6,-132,242,-141,96,1211,-5729,10617,-16741,30916,-30497,-32267,145346,-220795,203511,-129594,60922,-21949,5960,-1084,96,0]

At 0.5 the difference is exactly (-10145) % 524288 ~= -0.01935, thus the relative difference is around 1/1000.

The difference varies between around +0.0139 (near 0.32) and around -0.0427 (near 0.68). The maximal relative difference is under 0.3% of the maximum of p8.

## Hints at asymptotic behaviour

To sum up, if a_k is the cost at p=0.5 of the k-level iterated 3-bit majority, we have

+ a_1 = 5/2 = 2.5
+ a_2 = 393/64 = 6.140625
+ a_3 = 15796051 % 1048576 ≃ 15.064288139343262

There is a proof in the literature that a_k^(1/k) will converge to some 2.25 <= L < 2.5 and that the limit is equal to (lim inf a_k^(1/k)).

+ a_1^(1/1) = 2.5
+ a_2^(1/2) ≃ 2.478028450199876
+ a_3^(1/3) ≃ 2.4697303458263957

Thus, we can see that L < 2.47 - a very slight improvement on L < 2.5.

We can conjecture that a_4^(1/4) is close to 2.47, thus a_4 is close to 2.47^4 ≃ 37.2.
